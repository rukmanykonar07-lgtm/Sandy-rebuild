"""
Sandy's live-editable config: LLM credit caps + preferences.
Stored as simple key/value rows in Supabase (table: sandy_config).
Sandy reads/writes this via chat — no files to open, no redeploy.

One-time setup (run once in Supabase SQL editor):

    create table sandy_config (
        key text primary key,
        value jsonb not null,
        updated_at timestamptz default now()
    );

ponytail: a flat key/value table, not a rules engine. Add structure
only when a real need for it shows up (e.g. per-user caps).

--- in-process cache (added) -------------------------------------------
Every call_llm() call was doing 3 Supabase round-trips just for cap
bookkeeping: get_config("caps"), get_config("usage"), set_config("usage",
...). On a multi-call tier (judge rounds, orchestrator rounds) that's
3x N network hops before any actual LLM work happens.

This is safe to cache in-process with NO ttl (not "cache for 30s and
hope") because sandy_config has exactly one writer: this module, in
this one process. Dockerfile runs a single uvicorn process (no
--workers), so there is no second process that could mutate the table
out from under this cache. Every write path below goes through
set_config/delete_config, which update the cache in the same breath --
so the cache literally cannot go stale while this process is alive.
If Sandy is ever scaled to multiple replicas/workers, this cache
becomes wrong and needs to switch to a real ttl or a pub/sub
invalidation -- flagging that assumption explicitly here so it isn't
forgotten later.

atomic_update() also fixes a real (pre-existing, not introduced by
this cache) lost-update race: two concurrent requests (FastAPI's
threadpool makes overlapping /chat calls genuinely concurrent, not just
async-interleaved) could both read usage, both increment their own
local copy, then both write -- the second write silently clobbers the
first's increment, undercounting real usage against the cap. A single
process-wide lock around the whole read-check-write closes this for
free, because everything is one process.

# caps -- one extra row, not a new Supabase Storage bucket or a new

# names, not the actual run history), so storing its whole content as
# one jsonb value is the lazy-and-correct move here. Job *output*
# (progress notes in ~/.hermes/cron/output/) is NOT covered by this --
# that's runtime history, not the registration Sandy needs to keep
# actually running a job, and it's a bigger sync problem for another day.
