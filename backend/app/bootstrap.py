"""Composition root -- the ONE place a Supabase client gets constructed.

Before this file existed, config.py, chatlog.py, events.py, and
projects.py each had their own private `_client: Client | None = None`
+ `_db()`/`_c()` lazy-singleton, all doing the exact same
create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY-or-SUPABASE_KEY) dance.
Five copies of the same construction logic means five places that can
drift out of sync (e.g. one forgets the service-key-first fallback), and
five places a test has to separately monkeypatch to fully isolate a test
from the network.

Everything now goes through config.get_client(), which delegates here --
so the existing `fake_db` pytest fixture (which patches
config.get_client) transparently covers chatlog/events/projects too, not
just config.py itself. That's not just deduplication for its own sake:
it's the concrete testability win the repository-pattern skill calls out.

ponytail: still a plain function, not a class-based DI container --
Sandy has exactly one real dependency to wire (Supabase), so a
container would be solving a problem this codebase doesn't have yet.
Revisit if a second swappable backend genuinely shows up.
