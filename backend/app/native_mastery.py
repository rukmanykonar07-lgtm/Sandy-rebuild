"""Sandy's OWN mastery engine -- the 'my mastery' side of the comparison
Ruk wants against Hermes's cron-based path. Reuses brain._orchestrate
(the real planner -> parallel-workers -> verifier-loop -> synthesis
pattern already proven in chat) instead of reinventing it -- don't build
a second orchestrator when a real one already exists.

Division from mastery.py (Hermes path):
- mastery.py hands the approved plan to Hermes's own agent runtime,
  which executes autonomously via cron, outside Sandy's own process.
- This module runs the SAME kind of approved plan through Sandy's own
  process, using her own orchestrator directly.

Full lifecycle Ruk actually wants (per his spec):
  propose -> edit (feedback ACTUALLY changes weights/caps/mode, not
  just the displayed text) -> confirm -> running -> pause/resume ->
  continue (the real "do the next chunk now" trigger scheduled mode
  was missing entirely before) -> done. Ruk can add/remove weighted
  models and set a per-job call cap on any model at any point; a round
  that turns out genuinely hard can pull in extra capped-but-unweighted
  models automatically. Every real step is a real event.py row -- same
  data the orb graph and (via list_jobs below) Workflows/Agents render.

Jobs are stored in a REAL relational table, native_mastery_jobs (real
columns, real types -- see migration_rdbms.sql) -- not a jsonb blob
under a generic key-value store. A job surviving HF container
sleep/restart between propose and confirm (or mid-pause) is the whole
point; an in-memory dict was the exact cause of "confirmed" silently
falling into a hallucinated fake job before the first rewrite, and the
jsonb-blob approach worked but wasn't real relational storage, which is
what this table now is.

Day 2 of the rebuild: healing.py isn't in the repo yet (Day 3). The
failure-alert path is wrapped in try/except, so a real _run() crash
logs an obstacle event AND attempts the alert, but the alert itself
can no-op gracefully when healing isn't loaded yet -- the run still
records its failed state and the user can still see it.

# Real race condition, found by deliberately walking through concurrency
# scenarios (not hit by chance): _orchestrate() runs multiple workers for
# the SAME job concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor. _bump_usage does a
# read-modify-write (get_job -> mutate dict -> _save_job) -- two workers
# finishing at the same instant can both read usage=N, both compute N+1,
# both write N+1, and one real increment silently vanishes. For a job
# with a real per-provider cap set, that means Ruk's own cap is quietly
# enforced less accurately than it looks, with no error anywhere.
#
# A per-job threading.Lock (not a DB-level lock/RPC) is the right-sized
# fix: all the concurrency here is ThreadPoolExecutor workers inside ONE
# Python process (HF Spaces runs a single container) -- there's no
# multi-instance/distributed concurrency to defend against, so adding
# Postgres-level atomic increment machinery would be solving a problem
# that doesn't exist at this scale.
#
# Honest limit this does NOT close: the provider_guard CHECK (before a
# call starts) and the bump (after it finishes) are still two separate
# moments -- two workers can both pass the cap check a moment apart, then
# both bump, overshooting the cap by a small amount in a rare near-
# simultaneous case. Caps here are a soft spend guardrail, not a hard
# billing limit, so this residual gap is an accepted tradeoff, not
# something silently ignored -- fully closing it would mean holding a
# lock across the entire external LLM call (real latency), which isn't
# worth it for a soft internal guardrail. This fix closes the definitely-
# worse bug (silently LOSING real usage counts), not the boundary case.
#
# SECOND real race found the same way (scenario-walking, then confirmed
# with an actual concurrent test, not assumed): _run()'s finishing write
# reads the job early, does the whole orchestrator run, then saves the
# WHOLE job dict back -- if pause()/resume() write a different state
# while _run() is mid-flight, _run()'s stale in-memory copy silently
# overwrites the ENTIRE row (not just state) when it finally saves. This
# is worse than the usage race: it can clobber a real pause, not just
# undercount a number. Confirmed with a real threaded test before fixing.
#
# One lock, generalized to guard every real read-modify-write on a job
# (usage bumps AND state transitions) -- not two separate locking
# schemes for what's the same underlying problem.
