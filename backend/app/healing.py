"""Failure awareness -- the piece that was missing entirely: a job could
error out and Sandy would just... sit on it until Ruk happened to ask.

Two honest limits, stated up front because they shape everything below:
1. Hermes's cron runner is a SEPARATE OS process (supervisord's
   'gateway'). Sandy's own FastAPI process cannot intercept an exception
   INSIDE it live -- there is no hook for that from here. What this
   module does instead: poll each job's real last_error/state after the
   fact and alert on a NEW failure, same as Hermes's own ticker already
   works on a poll loop. Same HF-sleep dependency as everything else --
   this only runs while the container is awake.
2. "Reply on WhatsApp to confirm" would need an inbound webhook (a real
   Meta App Dashboard config on Ruk's side) that doesn't exist yet. This
   module sends the alert (real function, was dead code in projects.py)
   and Ruk confirms back in CHAT -- same confirm pattern already in use
   everywhere else, no new trust model invented.

For OUR OWN execution paths (native_mastery._run) failures ARE caught
live, in-process, same as before -- this module classifies them.

    the answer. Only runs for the two kinds that are known dead ends on
    their own: 'unknown' (no pattern matched at all) and
    'hermes_internal_bug' (its own _PATTERNS entry above already says
    the real cause is 'whichever error appears just before this one in
    the log' -- but nothing ever actually looked before this).

    Two real steps, each only tried if the previous one didn't resolve
    it -- never both unconditionally, so a clean case still costs
    nothing extra:
    1. Read Sandy's own real gateway log (get_gateway_logs -- already
       fixed in an earlier session to actually be readable from her own
       process) for a DIFFERENT line naming this job, and re-classify
       THAT text. If it matches a real known pattern, this IS the true
       root cause -- root_cause/fix_kind get updated for real, because
       this is deterministic: the same log content re-checked later
       finds the same match, so the healing_ledger dedup check (which
       keys on root_cause) stays stable.
    2. Only if step 1 found nothing better, run ONE real web search on
       the literal error text for research context. This result is
       NEVER written into root_cause/fix_kind -- search results aren't
       deterministic across polls (different top hit, different
       phrasing), so folding them into the dedup key would create a
       fresh duplicate ledger row roughly every poll instead of one
       real alert. It goes in the separate `research_note` field
       instead: shown to Ruk, stored for later, excluded from dedup.

    Critical boundary, unchanged from before: neither step is allowed
    to produce or apply an automatic fix on its own. propose_fix()
    still only ever returns a real MODELS[...]-backed value for the
    fix_kinds it already recognized. Research here only makes what
    Sandy TELLS Ruk better-informed -- it never expands what she's
