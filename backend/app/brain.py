"""
Decides HOW to answer a task:
  simple       -> 1 LLM
  medium       -> 2 LLMs, judged
  complex      -> 3 LLMs, judged
  very_complex -> orchestrator mode (loop engineering)

Ruk can always override with plain language ("use only gemini",
"start orchestrator mode") — that's parsed in main.py and passed in
here as `override`, which always wins over auto-classification.

Orchestration shape (Part 6 conformance, verified against _orchestrate
2026-08-26 — this docstring is the contract):

    Research  -> Gemini researches multiple angles BEFORE planning
    Plan      -> 2-4 concrete sub-tasks, each with its research slice
    Dispatch  -> workers execute in parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor)
    HARD BARRIER -> orch_barrier_map: NO new work until EVERY worker
                 of the round has returned (or the stall watchdog cuts
                 the round loose with best-so-far)
    Review    -> per-worker self-check (_self_check_output), THEN one
                 orchestrator pass reviewing ALL outputs together,
                 specifically hunting CONFLICTS between workers
    Combine   -> conflicts surfaced/arbitrated, gaps become next round's
                 sub-tasks; research IS allowed mid-run (review step can
                 request one targeted extra search per round)

Rounds repeat up to MAX_ORCHESTRATOR_ROUNDS; every LLM call in every
phase flows through _counted/_call_guarded so MAX_ORCH_CALLS is a true
per-request ceiling, and each return doubles as the stall watchdog's
progress heartbeat.

    ask for one extra targeted search of their own on top of what
    Gemini gave them) -- then instead of immediately handing out new
    sub-tasks, Gemini reviews ALL worker output together, specifically
    checking for CONFLICTS between workers (this is where real bugs
    come from in multi-agent builds -- two workers independently
    assuming different things about the same piece, not any one worker
    being wrong), researches again only if something's genuinely
    unresolved, and only then replans holistically for the next round.
    Every step degrades gracefully -- a failure anywhere falls back to
    the best available partial result, never an unhandled crash.

    on_event(event_type, summary, round, provider=None, detail=None) --
    optional hook, called at each real transition (research/planning/
    worker-done/conflict/replan/synthesis). Used by native_mastery.py to
    log real events for the orb graph. Default None -- normal chat use
    (brain.answer) never sets this, so behavior/cost here is completely
    unchanged for every existing caller.

    workers -- optional custom round-robin worker list (e.g. weighted by
    Ruk's per-run provider percentages for a native mastery run). Default
    None keeps the original ["groq", "cerebras"] behavior exactly as
    before -- existing chat callers are unaffected.

    extra_workers -- optional models NOT in the normal rotation that only
    get pulled in once a round needed real replanning (i.e. the task
    turned out genuinely hard) -- native_mastery.py's "add more models if
    the task is hard" behavior. Default None = never used, unchanged for
    every existing caller.

    provider_guard(provider) -> bool -- optional per-call check, used by
    native_mastery.py to enforce Ruk's own per-JOB provider caps (on top
    of, not instead of, llm.py's global daily cap). A provider failing
    this check is skipped for that call, same as a capped/failed provider
    already is. Default None = no extra check, unchanged for every
    existing caller.

    should_continue() -> bool -- optional pause check, polled once per
    replan round (the only real checkpoint this loop has -- there's no
    finer mid-round pause). Returns False -> stop and return the best
    result so far instead of continuing to replan. Default None = never
    stops early, unchanged for every existing caller.

    orchestrator -- which provider runs the research/plan/review/replan
    role. Was hardcoded to "gemini" regardless of what was passed in
    here -- meaning a native mastery job configured to barely use
    Gemini still burned up to ~8 Gemini calls per round on
    orchestration alone (research + planning, then review + replan per
    round, up to MAX_ORCHESTRATOR_ROUNDS). Default None -> "gemini",
    so normal chat use (brain.answer, which never passes this) is
